Welcome to the Plate Documentation site. Navigate using the sidebar or top menu.

## Before you begin...
This documentation site is meant for developers building sites on the Plate platform. Throughout the documentation you will be referred to as `site builder` or `developer`.

The documentation also speaks about `user` or `end user`. This is the user that you build the site for, maybe your client. He will be the one to use your theme, and fill his Plate website with content and create the pages layout with the [nested layout components](/docs/getting-started#the-plate-nested-layout-structure).
