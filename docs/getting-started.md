# Getting started

Getting started as a developer for Plate.

## How does Plate work?

Plate is a frontend-based Content Management System (CMS) that offers clean simplicity in terms of content editing; the user does not have to manage his content in a backend, but edits it inline. That is what makes Plate truly WYSIWYG. The layout of a post in Plate is built out of the following layout components.

`Post` > `Section` > `Row` > `Column` > `Content Element`

The dragging/dropping of content elements, and resizing plus changing orders of sections, rows and columns gives the user ultimate freedom to set up the posts layout as he sees fit.
